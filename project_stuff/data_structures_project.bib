	abstract = {"Michael Sipser's philosophy in writing this book is simple: make the subject interesting and relevant, and the students will learn. His emphasis on unifying computer science theory - rather than offering a collection of low-level details - sets the book apart, as do his intuitive explanations. Throughout the book, Sipser - a noted authority on the theory of computation - builds students' knowledge of conceptual tools used in computer science, the aesthetic sense they need to create elegant systems, and the ability to think through problems on their own. {INTRODUCTION} {TO} {THE} {THEORY} {OF} {COMPUTATION} provides a mathematical treatment of computation theory grounded in theorems and proofs. Proofs are presented with a "proof idea" component to reveal the concepts underpinning the formalism. Algorithms are presented using prose instead of pseudocode to focus attention on the algorithms themselves, rather than on specific computational models. Topic coverage, terminology, and order of presentation are traditional for an upper-level course in computer science theory. Users of the Preliminary Edition (now out of print) will be interested to note several new chapters on complexity theory: Chapter 8 on space complexity; Chapter 9 on provable intractability, and Chapter 10 on advanced topics, including approximation algorithms, alternation, interactive proof systems, cryptography, and parallel computing." -- Publisher's description.},

[This book] is suitable as a supplement to courses in algorithm design, computational complexity, operations research, or combinatorial mathematics, and as a text for seminars on approximation algorithms or computational complexity. It provides not only a valuable source of information for students but also an essential reference work for professionals in computer science"--Back cover.},

	isbn = {978-1-4008-4110-3},
	shorttitle = {The Traveling Salesman Problem},
	abstract = {This book presents the latest findings on one of the most intensely investigated subjects in computational mathematics--the traveling salesman problem. It sounds simple enough: given a set of cities and the cost of travel between each pair of them, the problem challenges you to find the cheapest route by which to visit all the cities and return home to where you began. Though seemingly modest, this exercise has inspired studies by mathematicians, chemists, and physicists. Teachers use it in the classroom. It has practical applications in genetics, telecommunications, and neuroscience. The authors of this book are the same pioneers who for nearly two decades have led the investigation into the traveling salesman problem. They have derived solutions to almost eighty-six thousand cities, yet a general solution to the problem has yet to be discovered. Here they describe the method and computer code they used to solve a broad range of large-scale problems, and along the way they demonstrate the interplay of applied mathematics with increasingly powerful computing platforms. They also give the fascinating history of the problem--how it developed, and why it continues to intrigue us.},

	abstract = {This chapter retraces the joint history of operations research and the traveling salesman problem. After presenting the problem, it proposes first exact then approximation algorithms for various versions of the problem: minimization or maximization, metric instances, binary distances, etc. Some of these algorithms put into practice general solving models such as the branch-and-bound strategy, dynamic programming or local search. The chapter presents two algorithms that approximate Maximum traveling salesman problem ({MAX} {TSP}) according to two performance ratio measures: the standard ratio and the differential ratio. It also presents some algorithms that approximate minimum traveling salesman problem ({MIN} {TSP}) according to the standard and differential ratios. Constructive algorithms are close to greedy algorithms, in the sense that they consist of making a “once for all” choice with each iteration. The chapter explains the nearest neighbor algorithm formally, use the functional notation described in the elementary properties section to characterize Hamiltonian cycles.},
